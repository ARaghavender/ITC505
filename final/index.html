        <p>The main objective of the game is to turn on all the lights on the board, with an alert box appearing with
            the message "You Finished the Game Successfully!" once completed. The game board is a 5x5 grid where
            initially, some lights are randomly turned on. The player needs to toggle the lights logically until all
            lights on the board are turned on. Clicking the "New Game" button resets the game to its initial state,
            while the "Help" button displays a dialog box with game instructions and a close button. The 5x5 grid layout
            is designed using CSS grid layout, balancing the size of the cells and the spacing between them. A random
            initial state ensures replayability, with at least one light turned on at the beginning for engagement.
            Achieving a balanced difficulty was challenging due to the random starting state, with different setups
            tested to maintain a fair challenge. Implementing clear visual feedback for toggling lights was crucial,
            reflecting the player's actions through CSS classes that control light states and manipulate DOM elements.
            Careful planning of the interface design and event handling for each cell created an intuitive and
            responsive interface, ensuring smooth cell interactions and a user-friendly game experience. The game
            identifies a win condition when all lights are turned on, providing immediate gratification and feedback by
            iterating over the grid and displaying a success message.</p>
